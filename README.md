# Mass Time Game

The purpose of this project is to test time dilation, pausing and resuming
of a UE Mass simulation.

For this project to compile and run, you need to be using Xist's custom UE5 engine
(the [`xist-mass`](https://github.com/XistGG/UnrealEngine/tree/xist-mass) branch)
which is based on Epic's `ue5-main` Github branch.

I set the `EngineAssociation = ""` in the `.uproject` so you can clone this in the
custom Engine source directory.
